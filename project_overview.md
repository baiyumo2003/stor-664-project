# STOR 664: Project Assignment

Instructor: Dan Kessler

Fall 2025

The course project is an opportunity to put into practice what we have
learned in class: you will apply statistical methods in order to shed light
on a question you find interesting. You will need to choose your question,
identify a dataset that you can use, develop an analysis plan, execute your
analysis plan, and then interpret your results. Your analysis must involve
regression analysis in some way, but beyond that you have broad
flexibility. 

You may work in groups of up to four students (smaller groups are fine, too).
Students in the same group will receive the same grade. While all students in a
group are jointly responsible for the work, it is acceptable to divide the
workload in a way that all group members feel is fair, e.g., having one member
of the group focus on code/results and another member focus on writing.

To keep the project on track, it will be completed in two parts: (1)
Introduction and Data Exploration, and (2) Analysis & Results, and Discussion.
Each part will have its own deliverables and deadlines. By the end of the
semester you will have written a concise, well-structured analytic project that
answers your chosen question with a well-structured and reproducible repository
to share your process.

Please prepare your report as two different documents; at each deadline you will
submit your report as a PDF. The sections, their suggested content, and
deadlines (all 11:59 PM ET) are as follows.

---

1) (i) Introduction and (ii) Data Exploration (due Sunday 11/16/2025)
- Determining what question you want to answer
  - What is your null hypothesis(es)?
- Identifying your dataset
- Looking for existing literature/projects about this question
- Producing at least one figure from your data that can be used towards answering your question
- Pointing out and addressing any concerns about your data's ability to answer the question (data wrangling)
- Proposing an analysis plan for your data

2) (iii) Analysis & Results, and (iv) Discussion (due Wednesday 12/3/2025)
- Carrying out your full statistical analysis regarding your hypothesis
- Discussing your analytical decisions (why did you choose your models, how did you account for any limitations)
- Examining your results with figures and/or tables
- Answering the questions:
    - Were your answers conclusive? If not, what could have been done to make them conclusive?
    - Were your assumptions reasonable?
    - What limitations did your data and/or analysis have?
- Discussing future extensions for your work

## Grading 

The project will count for 25% of your final grade in the class.
It is worth 25 points: Part 1 (Introduction and Data Exploration) will be worth 10 points, Part 2 (Analysis & Results, and Discussion) will be worth 10 points, and the remaining 5 points will be distributed depending on your repository, peer-reviewing, and presentation.

Your report should include in-text citations (and accompanying bibliography) when you rely on external resources (e.g., if your dataset is taken from a published paper, you should cite it), but in general when you rely
on things you learned in class you do not need to provide citations. You can adhere to whatever standards you prefer (e.g., APA).
We suggest you prepare your report in LaTeX, but you can use whatever tool
you prefer so long as it produces a PDF. The length of the report will vary
substantially depending on how you typeset it and how many figures/tables
you include, but each of your five sections should contain no fewer than three
paragraphs of written text (although they may be appreciably longer than
that).

Your project should reflect new work, i.e., it should not be recycled from
something that you have already done for another class or in the course of a
research project (although you are free to use data with which you already
familiar). Of course, if you find your project interesting and wish to continue
working on it after the class (with an eye to eventual publication), you are
free to do so. Indeed, if you are engaged in research, it may be wise to
choose a project that aligns with your research (e.g., this is an opportunity
to become familiar with a dataset or scientific area that you anticipate using
in the course of your other work).

There should be an area for acknowledgments at the end of your report in
line with the course requirements for all submitted work. In addition to the
usual reporting, it should also address how each group member contributed
to the project (e.g., "Shaleni wrote the majority of the report, but Dan
conducted the analysis and made the figures"). It should be included at
each submission deadline and should get progressively more detailed as you
work through the project.
