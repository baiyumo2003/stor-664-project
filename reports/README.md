# Report Folder

This folder contains all written components of the project.  These can be PDFs of the two parts of your report. If you wish, you can also include the source files used to generate the reports, but this is optional.

## Structure
```text
report/
├── 01_part1_slides.pdf # Slides for part1, including: Question of interest, background, motivation, data sources, initial exploration
├── 01_part1_report.pdf # Report in part1, more comprehensive version than slide!
├── # Analysis plan, findings and figures, interpetation, limitations, conclusions to be shown in the future!
```

## Key Point!
- Each file will also be uploaded to Gradescope for grading!
