# Report Folder

This folder contains all written components of the project.  These can be PDFs of the two parts of your report. If you wish, you can also include the source files used to generate the reports, but this is optional.

## Structure
```text
report/
├── 01_introduction_and_exploration.pdf # Question of interest, background, motivation, data sources, initial exploration
├── 02_analysis_results_discussion.pdf  # Analysis plan, findings and figures, interpetation, limitations, conclusions
```

## Expectations
- Each file should also be uploaded to Gradescope for grading.
